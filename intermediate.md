## 🔍 Understanding Subqueries – SELECT vs FROM

Subqueries can feel tricky at first, but once you get the core difference — it's game over.

---

### ✅ Subquery in `SELECT`
```sql
SELECT name, 
  (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees) AS highest_salary 
FROM employees;
```

**What it does:**  
- Runs the inner query **again and again** for each row in the outer query.
- Useful for comparing every row with an overall value (like max, avg, etc).

**Real-world analogy:**  
📄 You're reading through every student's marks, and on each page, you also write *"Topper's score: 99."*

---

### ✅ Subquery in `FROM`
```sql
SELECT dept, total 
FROM (
  SELECT department AS dept, COUNT(*) AS total 
  FROM employees 
  GROUP BY department
) AS dept_counts 
WHERE total > 5;
```

**What it does:**  
- Runs the inner query **once**, creates a mini temporary table.
- Outer query works on that result like it’s a regular table.

**Real-world analogy:**  
📊 You first prepare a summary sheet: “How many students in each class?”  
Then you ask: “Now show me classes that have more than 5 students.”

---

### ✨ Your Insight (Perfectly Validated):
> **In case of `FROM`, it’s like creating a table first and then running operations on it.  
But in `SELECT`, it feels like it’s doing the operation again and again for every row.**

**Yes! That’s the core truth, and now you own it.**

### 📌 TL;DR Comparison

| Feature                      | Subquery in `SELECT`                          | Subquery in `FROM`                          |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Runs per row?               | ✅ Yes (for each row)                          | ❌ No (runs once)                            |
| Returns                     | A single scalar value                         | A full table (rows + columns)               |
| When to use                 | To add calculated or fixed value per row      | To group/filter data before querying it     |
| Analogy                     | Ask a question on every student's page        | Prepare a report sheet and work from that   |

### 💡 Bonus Thought:
- You can **nest both** together for power plays (e.g., subquery in FROM, then SELECT over it, then another subquery in SELECT).
- That’s how analysts and backend devs do black magic in dashboards.

# **SQL Warm-Up Part 3: Joins, Aggregates & Subqueries – With Real-Life Vibes**  
> When Simba meets Bhaskar, or Pooja’s name pops up from a secret list — that’s SQL magic in action!

---

## 1. **INNER JOIN – Show Matches from Both Tables**  
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name AS department_name 
FROM employees e 
JOIN departments d 
ON e.department_id = d.id;
```  
**Meaning:**  
🔗 *"Match employees with their department name, but only when there’s a valid match in both tables."*  
Like: *“Show students who have been assigned a class teacher.”*  
No class teacher, no show!

---

## 2. **LEFT JOIN – Keep Everyone from the Left Table**  
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name AS department_name 
FROM employees e 
LEFT JOIN departments d 
ON e.department_id = d.id;
```  
**Meaning:**  
🧩 *"Show all employees. If someone has no department, leave it blank."*  
Like: *“List all kids—even those who haven’t been assigned a classroom yet.”*

---

## 3. **RIGHT JOIN – Focus on Right Table**  
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name AS department_name 
FROM employees e 
RIGHT JOIN departments d 
ON e.department_id = d.id;
```  
**Meaning:**  
🧠 *"Show all departments and any employees in them. Even if no one is working in a department, still show it!"*  
Like: *“Show all class sections, even if they’re empty.”*

---

## 4. **FULL JOIN – Everyone’s Invited**  
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name AS department_name 
FROM employees e 
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d 
ON e.department_id = d.id;
```  
**Meaning:**  
🌍 *"Show everything from both tables, matched or not."*  
Like: *“List all kids and all class sections, even if no match exists.”*

---

## 5. **Aggregates – Magic Math Functions**

### a. **COUNT – How Many?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
```  
🔢 *“How many total employees are there?”*

---

### b. **AVG – Average Salary**
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
```  
⚖️ *“What’s the average salary of all employees?”*

---

### c. **SUM – Add All Values**
```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;
```  
💰 *“How much salary do we pay in total every month?”*

---

### d. **MAX / MIN – Highest or Lowest**
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
```  
👑 *“Who earns the most?”*

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;
```  
🐣 *“Who earns the least?”*

---

## 6. **GROUP BY – Create Mini Groups**  
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;
```  
📦 *"Count how many employees are in each department."*  
Like: *“How many kids in each class?”*

---

## 7. **HAVING – Condition on Grouped Data**  
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```  
🎯 *“Show only those departments where average salary is more than ₹50,000.”*  
You’re now filtering the filtered!

--

## 8. **Subqueries – A Query Inside a Query**

### a. **Above Average Earners**
```sql
SELECT name 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```  
🧙 *“List those who earn more than the average salary.”*

### b. **Use Subquery in FROM**
```sql
SELECT dept, total 
FROM (
  SELECT department AS dept, COUNT(*) AS total 
  FROM employees 
  GROUP BY department
) AS dept_counts 
WHERE total > 5;
```  
🔍 *“Only show departments that have more than 5 employees.”*

---

### c. **Subquery in SELECT**
```sql
SELECT name, 
  (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees) AS highest_salary 
FROM employees;
```  
👀 *“For each person, also show the highest salary in the company.”*
